<h1><b>Computer Graphics Assignments Repository</b></h1>

Welcome to the Computer Graphics Assignments repository! This repository contains a series of projects focused on computer graphics implemented in C++ using OpenGL (via Glut.h). Each assignment explores various concepts and techniques in computer graphics, including rendering 3D models, textures, animation, and user interaction via keyboard and mouse inputs.

<br>

<h2>Assignments Overview</h2>
<br>
<h3>Project 1: Rendering Infinite Leaves on a Branch (2D Image)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Description: Render a 2D image depicting infinite leaves on a branch.</li>
  <li>Files: main.cpp</li>
  <li>Instructions: Run the program.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Project 2: Rendering and Manipulating 3D Models</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Description: Render three 3D models (Teapot, Sphere, Cube) and enable user-controlled movement.</li>
  <li>Files: main.cpp</li>
  <li>Instructions: Run the program.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Project 3: 3D Animation of Solar System</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Description: Render a 3D animation featuring the moon, sun, and earth, mimicking planetary orbit.</li>
  <li>Files: main.cpp</li>
  <li>Instructions: Press the space button to initiate the animation and observe the planet's movements.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Project 4: Creating and Rendering a Skybox</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Description: Generate a skybox with textured layers to simulate an environment and render a movable object within it.</li>
  <li>Files: main.cpp</li>
  <li>Instructions: Run the program to interact with the movable object within the skybox environment.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Project 5: Advanced Skybox Environment with Interactive Models</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Description: Enhance the skybox project by adding environmental details and loading up to four interactive 3D models.</li>
  <li>Files: main.cpp</li>
  <li>Instructions: Utilize keyboard inputs to control the movement of the loaded 3D models within the environment.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Project 6: Rendering a Bunny Model with Realistic Texture and Light Manipulation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Description: Render a 3D model of a bunny with realistic fur texture and implement dynamic lighting controlled by mouse movement.</li>
  <li>Files: main.cpp</li>
  <li>Instructions: Move the mouse to manipulate the lighting source and observe its effects on the bunny model.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li>Ensure you have the glut.h file installed</li>
  <li>Navigate to the desired project directory.</li>
  <li>Compile the C++ source file using your preferred compiler (e.g., g++).</li>
  <li>Execute the compiled program and interact with the rendered graphics using the provided instructions.</li>
</ol>
